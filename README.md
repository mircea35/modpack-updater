# Modpack-Updater

This is a small program meant to update the modpack created by me.
This program is really user-friendly using a GUI and being as straightforward as possible.

## Usage

Firstly, select the folder where the mods should be.
Examples may be: In the curseforge instance or in .minecraft in the mods folder.

## Contributing

As this is purely for use with my friends, I do not expect any contributions.
Code suggestions are really welcomed especially if you see any critical flaws with the code.
